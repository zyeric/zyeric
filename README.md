### About Me

I am **Yi Zhu**, currently working as a **Senior Research Engineer** in the **System Research Group at MSRA**. My primary research focus is on **distributed training and inference for deep learning**.

### Selected Works
- **Core Contributor to [nnScaler](https://github.com/microsoft/nnscaler)**  
    - Played a key role in the early development of the `autodist` module, enabling efficient and feasible execution plans by considering memory consumption of deep learning models.  
    - Contributed to [YOCO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05254) and [Diff Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05258?), particularly in the distributed training phase for models with long sequences.  
    - Participated in [rStar-Math](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04519), providing suggestions for distributed training and inference.
- **Early Contributor to the Open-Source Distributed Training Framework [OneFlow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow)**
